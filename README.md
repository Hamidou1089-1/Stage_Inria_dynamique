# Internship Inria : Dynamique Stochastic on Networks

Presentation : 
I am Hamidou diallo, this is my repository for my internship in dynamique stochastic on networks, i will be modeling simulation process to analyse the structure 
of a network. Studie the speed of convergence of the state of the network. In the context of finance. 


Guide for the repository : 
 - src      -> Coding environnement
 - docs     -> documentation for packages of my code
 - Lecture  -> All the books and article links to my subject
 - test     -> Directory in case I discovered a new algorithm and test it performance(but it's essentially of my java environnement of coding)
 - build    -> Not essential for notebooks
